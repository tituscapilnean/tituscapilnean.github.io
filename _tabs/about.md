I lead go-to-market at Civic Technologies, helping developers integrate seamless, privacy-preserving identity solutions that balance security and user experience.

I've built and scaled high-impact demand generation programs, driving pipeline growth through content engines, sales funnels, and data-driven automation—turning ebooks, webinars, and research into revenue. On the technical side, I have worked on data pipelines, Jupyter notebooks, React components, Next.js functions, AWS Lambdas, Google Cloud Functions, CloudWatch alerts, SNS automations, and SendGrid integrations.

I currently work at the intersection of identity, AI, and growth. Whether it’s AI agents transforming GTM execution or decentralized identity redefining digital trust, I work with founders, builders, and decision-makers to push what’s possible.

Always open to conversations with developers, GTM leaders, and partners shaping the future of authentication, AI, and privacy.
