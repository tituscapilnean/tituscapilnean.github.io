TL;DR: We became landlords (again) shortly before leaving the US to nomad around South America for 8+ months in 2022. I found Avail, by Realtor.com to process ACH rent payments. It’s free for the tenant and $9/mo/unit for the landlord. 

Before my wife and I left the United States to travel as nomads around South America, we had to figure out what to do with our house in Austin. We didn’t want to sell it, but we also didn’t want it to sit empty while we were gone. That’s when we decided to become landlords and rent it out.

We had it on the market for a few weeks, first furnished, then unfurnished, until we found a family to enjoy our place as much as we did.

One of the things we had to do was find a way to handle the rent payments. We didn’t want to deal with checks, as they can be a hassle to work with, especially as we are traveling. Instead, we decided to look for a way to process ACH (Automated Clearing House) rent payments.

After some research, we found an early stage startup that seemed like it would be a good fit for us. They handled the ACH payments and made it easy for us to keep track of everything from afar. However, unfortunately, this startup folded after a few months, and we had to find another solution.

That’s when we discovered Avail. We tested their services for a few months, and we were really impressed with how easy they made it for us to manage the rent payments and communicate with our tenants. It’s free for the tenant to use, and it only costs $5 per month per unit for the landlord.

We’ve been using Avail since September, and it has been a lifesaver. It has made it easy for us to keep track of the rent payments and communicate with our tenants, even though we’re not in the country.

Overall, becoming landlords has been a great experience for us and using Avail has taken the guesswork out of the rental payment process.
