In content marketing, a well-structured management system is key. I’ve spent over 10 years building marketing and content management teams and have developed a system to help simplify the workflow. Here, I’ll share this system with you.

## The Naming System

Producing content involves many stages and different people, each with different access levels. To keep track, I use a naming system:

**[Person] [Access: Internal/External] [Type of File] – <Title>**

- The **‘Person’** tag shows who’s working on the document. In big teams, this helps us know who is responsible for a piece of content.
- The **‘Access’** tag shows if the user is an internal or external team member. This makes it easier to manage document access, avoiding mix-ups and protecting your content.
- The **‘Type of File’** tag shows whether the document is a content brief, a draft, or something else. This helps users quickly find what they’re looking for.
- Finally, the **‘Title’** shows what the content is about. It’s important to keep this short but clear to make it easy to find later on.

## Tracking Content Progress

Just naming files isn’t enough, though. You also need to track where they are in the creation process. This is where a project management tool like **JIRA** comes in.

Using a JIRA kanban board, you can follow your documents from the moment they’re created to when they’re published. My favorite categories are:

- **To Do** – for new tasks that need to be assigned.
- **With Writer** – shows which tasks are currently with writers.
- **In Review** – for content that’s being checked before final approval.
- **Published** – for content that’s completed and live.

## Conclusion

Using a clear naming system and tracking tool like JIRA makes managing content a lot easier. It simplifies teamwork and keeps the workflow clear. Give it a try and see how it improves your content marketing process.
