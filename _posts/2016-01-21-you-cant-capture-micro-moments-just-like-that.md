Recently read about Google’s VP of Marketing saying that the advertising game is “no longer about reach and frequency,” but about capturing micro-moments. While the micro-moment focus is not new coming from Google—they’ve been at it for a while—the real deal here is the fact that a VP of Marketing is suggesting dropping demographics and identity to focus on immediacy and intent.

The author citing the Google rep tries to steer away from just micro-moments, suggesting matching customer data with context, but that’s still not enough. Let’s think about a use case:

Imagine you are searching for something you need, like money transfers or a SIM card company for calling abroad.

Is it enough to stumble onto an ad?

What if that keyword group or market is saturated by competition and you see 10-15 different ads on a search result page?

How do you make up your mind which ones to click?

Then how do you make up your mind which ones to buy?

The short answer is that we don’t know for sure. But experience, past results, and methodologies show that one person buying a product or service will go through several stages until they purchase. That’s AIDA (Awareness, Interest, Desire, Action), in this example. A customer is unlikely to take action if they aren’t aware, interested, or desiring your product or service. To desire, they must first be interested, and to be interested, they must first become aware. While you can short-circuit the model with AdWords, you can do it only if the perceived risk is lower than the promised reward, and that’s difficult to assess if there is no awareness of your brand, product, or service.

To build that awareness → interest → desire flow of customers, you want to look at demographics, reach, and frequency of interaction with your multichannel touchpoints – that’s PR, events, offline branding, content marketing, emails, search ads, display ads, social media, endorsers, referrals, reviews. This mix becomes critical when you have a trust barrier to overcome, like in financial services or healthcare, for example, where the lack of delivery is financially or physically painful. In that case, AdWords alone cannot do the job. I like to compare its impact to that of the weapons in the case of the hunter and the hounds.

The hunter can only shoot the prey within her weapon range, so she has to spend a lot of energy going out and finding herds of deer. There are others out there too, so she might find herself heading to the pack, shooting or scaring the prey. So her best bet is to bring in hounds to find and steer the prey in her direction. That way, she doesn’t have to waste time and energy going towards packs or shooting from afar with little chance of success but rather have the deer come to her, chased by the hounds, making single sure shots.

But what are the right hounds (channels) to go for? How do you choose them? That’s where the narrative, strategy, product USPs, and experiments come in.
