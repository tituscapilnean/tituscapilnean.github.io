Since coming to the US in 2016, I’ve had on and off attempts to get back to public speaking, with some webinars, virtual events, but not podcasts.

So when Ciprian from MorphL – the AI platform for e-commerce – reached out to me about being on [Get your AI On](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/get-your-ai-on/episodes/6-Titus-Capilnean---Director--Corporate-Marketing-at-Appen-on-marketing-AI-products-ef7tvk), I was excited to jump in.

I’m really happy with how it turned out! You can listen to me and Ciprian talk about AI, marketing and entrepreneurship for about 36 minutes.

> A marketing campaign is not that different to how people think about AI projects, at a high level.

It took me 10 years of marketing and 4 years in the AI industry to figure this one out. I’m not going to spoil it by talking about the content anymore. You have to listen to it to get details.

Let me know if you liked it. Let me know if you didn’t.

As usual, I represented myself in the podcast, on my own free time, as a marketer and AI industry member. Ideas and thoughts are my own.
